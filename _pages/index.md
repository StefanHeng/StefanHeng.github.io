{% include title-script.html title="About | Stefan Heng" %}





I'm an undergraduate student at University of Michigan. I study Computer Science.

I interned at eBay Seller Experience as a front-end engineer.
Regarding research, I am fortunate to be mentored by [Dr. Mohammed Saeed](https://mcircc.umich.edu/members/mohammed-saeed-md-phd) and [Prof. Jason Mars](https://www.jasonmars.org).

I'm seeking a CS Ph.D. program.
