{% include title-script.html title="About | Stefan Heng" %}


I currently work as a Research Assistant at [CLARITY lab](https://www.jasonmars.org/2014/03/20/clarity-lab-at-university-of-michigan/).

I'm an incoming Master student in Computer Science at Georgia Tech.
I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at University of Michigan. I interned at eBay Seller Experience as a front-end engineer.
Regarding research, I am fortunate to be mentored by [Dr. Mohammed Saeed](https://mcircc.umich.edu/members/mohammed-saeed-md-phd) and [Prof. Jason Mars](https://www.jasonmars.org).

I'm seeking a CS Ph.D. program.
