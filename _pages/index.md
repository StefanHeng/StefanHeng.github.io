{% include title-script.html title="About | Stefan Heng" %}


Hello World!

I'm a Master's student in Computer Science at Georgia Tech, where I'm engaged in Large Language Model (LLM) research under the guidance of [Professor Chao Zhang](http://chaozhang.org).

I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at University of Michigan, during which I interned at eBay as a front-end engineer.
Regarding prior research, I am fortunate to be mentored by [Dr. Mohammed Saeed](https://mcircc.umich.edu/members/mohammed-saeed-md-phd) on ECG signal processing.
I also enjoyed working with Ph.D. student [Christopher Clarke](https://csclarke.com) and [Professor Jason Mars](https://www.jasonmars.org) on NLP.

<!-- I'm seeking a CS/NLP Ph.D. program. -->
