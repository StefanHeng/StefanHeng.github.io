{% include title-script.html title="About | Stefan Heng" %}

I'm an undergraduate senior student majoring in [Computer Science](https://cse.engin.umich.edu) at [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor](https://umich.edu).

Previously, I interned at eBay Seller Experience as a front-end engineer.
I am fortunate to be adviced by Dr. Mohammed Saeed.

I'm seeking for a Ph.D. program related to Computer Science for Fall 2022.
