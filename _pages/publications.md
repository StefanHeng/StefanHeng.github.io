    venue: "Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) Findings, 2023"
    desc: "We benchmark 3 transformer zero-shot text classification paradigms (cross-encoding, dual-encoding, generative) on 18 classification datasets among 3 domains with unseen labels during training. We found that integrating the dataset domain into training improves accuracy by 1% on average."
